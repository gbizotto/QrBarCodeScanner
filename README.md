# QrBarCodeScanner
Sample code in Kotlin for Bluebird BM180 and Chainway C6000 Android Rugged QR/bar code readers. The list can grow.

The goal of this project is to help developers to integrate to some devices QR or bar code scanners.

Examples available:
- Bluebird BM180
- Chainway C6000

Both of these devices send a broadcast when they read a code. The examples show:
- which action to listen to
- the key on the intent bundle where the code is.
